### Reasons not to use Wayland

Obs: these are issues found while using Niri wm, maybe it would work with other wms
  - I had a worst time the time I played around with Hyprland, so now I'm more confident

- not working: center search window by default (using Super+C to center manually)
- Blank camera on Vivaldi

Old issues I found acceptable workarounds for:
- Flameshot does not open on the correct monitor (using grim + slurp + satty for now)
- xwayland-satellite is not working properly with Webstorm
  - I can't focus inside the editor (to start using ideavim) without using the
  mouse, which defeats the purpose
  - I can somwhat use the Wayland version of Webstorm using the `-Dawt.toolkit.name=WLToolkit` flag but it's a little buggy
- Can't paste into the focused window from CopyQ (I'm really enjoying it, glad to try alternatives if I find any that looks good enough)
- Alternatives must support: paste into focused window, images
- try writing a script to work with niri
