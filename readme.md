### Dotfiles

This folder contains some of the dotfiles for my personal linux (and some macos) setup.

Use stow to symlink the dotfiles to your home directory.

```zsh
stow -t ~ */
```

There might be some useful information as comments in each config file. I find it easier
to have them there in their own context instead of here (also see the start of the files).
